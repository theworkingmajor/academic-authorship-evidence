# Academic Authorship Evidence

This repository collects research notes and conceptual frameworks on authorship
verification in academic writing, with a focus on the limitations of AI text
classification and the role of writing-process evidence.

## Motivation

AI-based text classifiers are increasingly used in academic misconduct cases.
However, these tools produce probabilistic outputs and are known to generate
false positives under certain conditions (e.g., extensive revision, ESL writing,
short texts).

This raises questions about what constitutes defensible evidence of authorship.

## Scope

The repository focuses on:
- Limitations of AI text detection
- False positives and bias
- Writing-process metadata as evidence
- Conceptual (non-implementation) frameworks

No production code is included.

## Intended audience

- Researchers in educational technology
- Academic integrity officers
- University administrators
- Policy makers

## Context and related work

This repository reflects research directions also explored in applied tools and
projects in the academic integrity space.
